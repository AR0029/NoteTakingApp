# Simple Note-Taking App

A clean and functional Android application built in Kotlin, allowing users to add, edit, and delete notes. This project was developed as a solution to a 1-hour internship coding challenge, demonstrating fundamental Android development skills, UI/UX design, and local data persistence.

## ‚ú® Features

* **Add Notes:** Easily create new notes with a title and content.
* **Edit Notes:** Modify existing notes by tapping on them or using the "Edit" button.
* **Delete Notes:** Remove unwanted notes with a confirmation dialog.
* **Local Persistence:** Notes are automatically saved to the device's local storage (using SharedPreferences) and persist even after the app is closed.
* **Empty State Handling:** Displays a friendly message when there are no notes.

## üöÄ Technologies Used

* **Kotlin:** Primary programming language for Android development.
* **Android SDK:** Core Android framework.
* **XML Layouts:** For declarative UI design.
* **RecyclerView:** Efficiently displays scrollable lists of notes.
* **Material Components:** For modern UI elements (e.g., FloatingActionButton, Buttons).
* **SharedPreferences:** Lightweight key-value storage for local data persistence.
* **Gson:** Google's JSON library for serializing/deserializing Note objects to/from JSON for storage.

## üí° How to Run the Project

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/AR0029/NoteTakingApp.git](https://github.com/AR0029/NoteTakingApp.git)
    ```
    (Note: I've assumed your repository name will be `NoteTakingApp` based on previous conversations. Please adjust if different.)
2.  **Open in Android Studio:**
    * Launch Android Studio.
    * Select `File` > `Open` and navigate to the cloned project directory.
3.  **Sync Gradle:** Allow Gradle to sync and download all necessary dependencies.
4.  **Run on an emulator or device:**
    * Select an emulator or connect an Android device.
    * Click the "Run" button (green triangle) in the toolbar.

## ‚úÖ Internship Challenge Criteria Met

* **Functionality:** Core features (Add, Edit, Delete) work as expected.
* **UI/UX Design:** Intuitive layout, responsive UI, user-friendly interactions.
* **Code Quality:** Clean, readable, and well-structured Kotlin code.
* **Bonus/Innovation:** Implemented local data persistence using SharedPreferences and Gson.

## ‚û°Ô∏è Future Enhancements (If more time were available)

* Implement a more robust database solution (e.g., Room Persistence Library).
* Add search functionality for notes.
* Implement sorting of notes (by date, title, etc.).
* Add categories/tags for notes.
* User authentication and cloud synchronization.
* Dark Mode theme.
